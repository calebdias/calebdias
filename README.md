# hello world

My name is Caleb Dias. Among other things, I enjoy riding motorcycles, tinkering with various Linux distributions, and occasional woodworking. I'm also an Amateur Extra class ham radio operator -- call sign W6CE.

Over past five years I've worked in the sheet metal fabrication industry doing IT, SolidWorks design, and nesting for fiber lasers. Before that I did freelance IT work for various local companies.

Now I'm on a personal mission to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I blame @gulci for making it look fun... maybe even useful.
